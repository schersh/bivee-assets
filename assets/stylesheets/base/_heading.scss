You can make individual headings and groups of headings with both the usual `h1 - h6` tags and also a few helper/microclasses to add special behaviors.

#### Helper classes

`h1 - h6` get global styles, which you can imitate with other tags (like `span`) if needed using these greek fraternity-esque helpers:

```
.alpha // looks like h1
.beta // looks like h2
.cappa // looks like h3
.delta // looks like h4
.epsilon // looks like h5
.zeta // looks like h6
```

`.highlight` is useful for making a heading bright and obnoxious. It will adapt the highlight color of its context (ie blue, orange, whatever).

##### Note on titles and subtitles

It's important to remember that the `h1, h2, h3`, etc. elements are not just for looks: they have a specific purpose in HTML. They're essential to the DOM Tree and, to your browser, they represent the beginning of a new section of content. HTML5 has a variety of what are called "sectioning" elements and headings are the most basic of those (`section`, `article`, and `aside` being more sophisticated sectioning containers).

What does this mean? Don't use an `h3` tag just because you wnat that size and style of type somewhere. Use it only to mark up a third-level section heading. If you just want the look of an `h3` in a non-sectioning context (like an article subtitle), use a generic element like `span` or `p` with the `.cappa` helper class.

Many modules (like `media-box`, `profile`, etc.) define their own special heading submodules to achieve a certain style regardless of the actual markup. If you're working in one of those modules, reach for the submodules first.
